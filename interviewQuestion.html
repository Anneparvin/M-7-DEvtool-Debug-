           <h1>Interview questions PAGE 1</h1> 
● What is JavaScript? 
    #ANS:-JavaScript is primarily a client-side language.it makes the site interactive.

● How does browser runs JavaScript?
    #ANS:- A javascript engine (sometimes also called an ECMAScript engine) is a piece of software that executes (runs) Javascript code in the browser, and not only (the V8 engine is a core component of the Node.js environment, for example)
    JavaScript engines are typically developed by web browser vendors, and every major browser has one. We said the most used browsers as of today are Chrome, Safari, Edge and Firefox. Each one is using a different Javascript engine.

● How does Browser works?
    #ANS:-When the web browser fetches data from an internet connected server, it uses a piece of software called a rendering engine to translate that data into text and images.

● HTTP vs HTTPS?
#ANS:-KEY DIFFERENCE
    1]HTTP lacks security mechanism to encrypt the data whereas 
    HTTPS provides SSL or TLS Digital Certificate to secure the communication between server and client.
    2]HTTP operates at Application Layer whereas 
    HTTPS operates at Transport Layer.
    3]HTTP by default operates on port 80 whereas 
    HTTPS by default operates on port 443.
    4]HTTP transfers data in plain text while HTTPS transfers data in cipher text (encrypt text).
    HTTP is fast as compared to HTTPS because HTTPS consumes computation power to encrypt the communication channel.
    
● Tell me something about JS engine v8 internal mechanism.
    V8 translates JavaScript code into more efficient machine code instead of using an interpreter. It compiles JavaScript ...
    This is a list of popular projects that are implementing a JavaScript engine:



● What is rerender in Browser?
    #ANS:-Rendering is a process used in web development that turns website code into the interactive pages users see when they visit a website.
    
● What is event loop in JavaScript?
    #ANS:-JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks.

● If javascript is single threaded, how does it handle asynchronous call?
    This means it has one call stack and one memory heap. As expected, it executes code in order and must finish executing a piece code before moving onto the next

● What is SSL?
    #ANS:-Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is an encryption security protocol. 

● Differences between setTimeOut and SetInterval?
    #ANS:-setTimeout allows us to run a function once after the interval of time. setInterval allows us to run a function repeatedly, starting after the interval of time, then repeating continuously at that interval.

● What is Regular Expression?
    #ANS:- a sequence of symbols and characters expressing a string or pattern to be searched for within a longer piece of text.
    contains {color, colour}

    ● Bom Vs Dom?
        1.Browser object Model --Document object model.
        2.use to access and manipulation of the browser window,
        used to manipulate the HTML window.
        3.Bom is superset,Dom is a subject of Bom.

    ● what is Cookies?
    1)Data stored in small text.
    2)stored in key value pairs

        ## (Another question) 
    1) Tell the difference Between Primitive and Non-Primitive Data Types in JavaScript.
    #ANSWER:--Primitive types are predefined (already defined) in Java. Non-primitive types are created by the programmer and is not defined by Java (except for String ).


    2) What are the Truthy and Falsy values? Give me some examples.
    #ANSWER:--Truthy values are values that evaluate to True in a boolean context. Falsy values are values that evaluate to False in a boolean context.
    
    truthyExample:------------
          false,Zero,Null,Undefined,String,'';
    falsyExample:....
          'false','0',(),{},[];

    
    3) What is the difference between null and undefined?
    #ANSWER:--undefined is a variable that refers to something that doesn't exist, and the variable isn't defined to be anything. null is a variable that is defined but is missing a value.

    4) What are the differences between double equal (==) and triple equal (===)?
    #ANSWER:The == operator does the type conversion of the operands before comparison, whereas the === operator compares the values as well as the data types of the operands
    
    5) What is scope in JavaScript?
    #ANSWER:--Scope in JavaScript refers to the current context of code, which determines the accessibility of variables to JavaScript.
    
    6) Define block scope and global scope.
    #ANSWER:--
    (local variables)--Variables that are declared inside a function are called local variables and in the function scope. Local variables are accessible anywhere inside the function. 
    (Block scope):-- Variable that is declared inside a specific block & can't be accessed outside of that block.
    (global scope)--the global scope is the scope that contains, and is visible in, all other scopes.
    
    7) What is hoisting in JavaScript?
    #ANSWER:--Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope .hoisting allows you to use functions and variables before they're declared.
    
    8) How to use the JavaScript callback function?
    #ANSWER:--A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function. Using a callback, you could call the calculator function ( myCalculator ) with a callback, 
    EXAMPLE:.........
    function myFirst() {
      myDisplayer("Hello");
    }
    
    function mySecond() {
      myDisplayer("Goodbye");
    }
    
    myFirst();
    mySecond();
    
    9) Explain closure in JavaScript
    #ANSWER:--A closure is a function having access to the parent scope, even after the parent function has closed. 
    EXAMPLE:.........
    <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>JavaScript Functions</h2>
<p>A function can access variables defined inside the function:</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
myFunction();

function myFunction() {
  let a = 4;
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = a * a;
}
</script>

</body>
</html>

    10) Explain passed by value and passed by reference.
    #ANSWER:-- "Passing by value" means that you pass the actual value of the variable into the function. 
    So, in your example, it would pass the value 9. 
    
    "Passing by reference" means that you pass the variable itself into the function (not just the value). 
    So, in your example, it would pass an integer object with the value of 9.

    1. What is a call stack?
2. Tell us about Try-catch?
3. Name some console APIs.
4. What is syntax error?
5. When do we get reference error?
6. a) what is wrong with the code below:
var foo;
console.log(foo.bar);
b) What type of error will the code generate?
c) What is the correct way to write the code?
