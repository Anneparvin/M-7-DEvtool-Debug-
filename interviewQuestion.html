● What is JavaScript? 
    #ANS:-JavaScript is primarily a client-side language.it makes the site interactive.

● How does browser runs JavaScript?
    #ANS:- A javascript engine (sometimes also called an ECMAScript engine) is a piece of software that executes (runs) Javascript code in the browser, and not only (the V8 engine is a core component of the Node.js environment, for example)
    JavaScript engines are typically developed by web browser vendors, and every major browser has one. We said the most used browsers as of today are Chrome, Safari, Edge and Firefox. Each one is using a different Javascript engine.

● How does Browser works?
    #ANS:-When the web browser fetches data from an internet connected server, it uses a piece of software called a rendering engine to translate that data into text and images.

● HTTP vs HTTPS?
#ANS:-KEY DIFFERENCE
    1]HTTP lacks security mechanism to encrypt the data whereas 
    HTTPS provides SSL or TLS Digital Certificate to secure the communication between server and client.
    2]HTTP operates at Application Layer whereas 
    HTTPS operates at Transport Layer.
    3]HTTP by default operates on port 80 whereas 
    HTTPS by default operates on port 443.
    4]HTTP transfers data in plain text while HTTPS transfers data in cipher text (encrypt text).
    HTTP is fast as compared to HTTPS because HTTPS consumes computation power to encrypt the communication channel.
    
● Tell me something about JS engine v8 internal mechanism.
    V8 translates JavaScript code into more efficient machine code instead of using an interpreter. It compiles JavaScript ...
    This is a list of popular projects that are implementing a JavaScript engine:



● What is rerender in Browser?
    #ANS:-Rendering is a process used in web development that turns website code into the interactive pages users see when they visit a website.
    
● What is event loop in JavaScript?
    #ANS:-JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks.

● If javascript is single threaded, how does it handle asynchronous call?
    This means it has one call stack and one memory heap. As expected, it executes code in order and must finish executing a piece code before moving onto the next

● What is SSL?
    #ANS:-Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is an encryption security protocol. 

● Differences between setTimeOut and SetInterval?
    #ANS:-setTimeout allows us to run a function once after the interval of time. setInterval allows us to run a function repeatedly, starting after the interval of time, then repeating continuously at that interval.

● What is Regular Expression?
    #ANS:- a sequence of symbols and characters expressing a string or pattern to be searched for within a longer piece of text.
